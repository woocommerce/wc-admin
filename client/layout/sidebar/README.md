Sidebar
======

This component contains the sidebar content. This is shown on every page, but conditionally hidden behind a toggle button in the Header.

## Separator

The `Separator` component is used to separate timeline entries by date. It accepts a required `label` prop (i.e. Today, Yesterday, 2 Days Ago, Last Week).
